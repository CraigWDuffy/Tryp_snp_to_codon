# Tryp_snp_to_codon
 Analysis of snp population data to identify alterations to codons within population datasets.

The code here was written to take vcf SNP data from trypanosome populations and then determine whether it leads to codon changes in the associated proteins. The code was written specifically for trypanosomes which do not generally use introns and as such does not account for their presence, alternative splicing etc.

popGen1.py is the initial script
popGen1ai.py is an amended script incorporating optimisation suggested by chatGTP
